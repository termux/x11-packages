## How to enable this repository

Repository is not enabled in Termux by default. First enable it to be able to install
its packages:
```
pkg install x11-repo
```

## Using X11 on Termux

Programs using the [X11 Windowing System] cannot be used standalone like normal
command-line utilities. Termux does not provide a native way for video output
and therefore you will need to install additional software.

The recommended setup is a [VNC] server (package `tigervnc`) running on
localhost and a [VNC Viewer] (by RealVNC Limited) Android application for
accessing the video output.

There possible to use other Xserver solutions like [XServer XSDL], but they are
not guaranteed to work properly with our packages.

More information about setting up a graphical environment is on the
[Termux Wiki].

**Only for Termux installations on Android 7.0 or higher.**
